This tool was created in order to facilitate the interaction between the new linux users and the termina. The name is the abbreviation of two words: Friendly Linux.
If you are new to linux I strongly recommend you to start by reading the manual of each command before using it, to do so you just have to type man followed by the name of the command.
As for this tool, you will find a wide range of menus helping you to carry out administrative tasks on your machine even if you do not yet master linux. This is intended for new linux users who are fed up with user interfaces that stagnate the brain and that are not yet accustomed to the terminal.
